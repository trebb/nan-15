Build firmware .hex and .eep files:

$ make KEYMAP=test all
  or
$ make KEYMAP=chord all


The factory-installed ATMEL bootloader works well in cases like the
test firmware where no EEPROM is involved.  For the chord firmware you
need to upload the LUFA bootloader (attach USBasp programmer):

$ make bootloader-dfu


Upload firmware to keyboard (press reset button):

$ make KEYMAP=test dfu
  or
$ make KEYMAP=chord dfu
$ make KEYMAP=chord dfu-ee


Generate keyboard documentation:

$ cd cheatsheet-generator
$ make

The chordmap cheatsheet is genereated from the textual represention in
./cheatsheet-generator/chordmap.txt.  To create a fresh chordmap.txt
reflecting the current customization state of the keyboard, invoke

$ cat > chordmap.txt

On the keyboard, press the appropriate chord to initiate chordmap
printing and wait for it to finish, then press Control-C to exit the
command.
